### Tensorflow version used is 1.14
The model employs a neural network model with 3 hidden layers. The 3 hidden layers have 100, 150, and 100 cells respectively.
The weights for the neural network nodes are intialized as a standard normal distribution

There are 2 dropout layers with 0.2 and 0.5 dropout rates.
